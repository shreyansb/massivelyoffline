![massivelyoffline.org, real world study groups for online classes](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1654579/Screenshots/u05o.png)

An app to bring together students of massively online classes, in the real world. Create a study group of up to 5 people, near you, and sometime in the next two weeks.

Made with [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) but this kind of app lends itself perfectly to [Meteor](http://meteor.com/)

Abandoned in favor of a bigger, more useful education project.
